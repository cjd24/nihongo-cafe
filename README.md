About this Site
------------
* A self-study resource for Japanese language.
* this website is based on my bookmarks for self-study Japanese, which I have gathered over the past 10 years. 
* I struggled getting any javascript to work for some reason. I'm not sure if its an updating issue or what. I intended to add a timer to every page (as can be seen in previous commits), a login function, and a hide/show div function. I don't really understand why javascript isn't working, so my next step will be to start from scratch.
